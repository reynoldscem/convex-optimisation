# convex-optimisation

Just messing around really. I'm doing [this](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~ryantibs/convexopt/) course, and the instructor mentioned that plotting the Positive semi-definite cone looks interesting.

So far the only thing in this repo is a plotting of that. It's plotted in each pair of the three dims which parametrise a 2x2 symmetric matrix.

A point is it's position on each axis, and the colour indicaters the 2-norm of the vector corresponding to each point.

As you can see it has a strange repeating block structure.
